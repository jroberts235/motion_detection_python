'''This is a video motion detector.

This uses about 5% CPU running with continuous motion detection on
a i5-3320M 2.6GHz with 16 GB RAM under no other load.

# The two main parameters that affect movement detection sensitivity

# CPU usage. In theory a smaller BLUR_SIZE should use less CPU, but
# for the range of values that are effective the difference is
# negligible. The default values are effective with on most light
# conditions with the cameras I have tested. At these levels the
# detectory can easily trigger on eye blinks, yet not trigger if the
# subject remains still without blinking. These levels will likely be
